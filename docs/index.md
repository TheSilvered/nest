## What is Nest

Nest is a little programming language developed with the idea of creating a
procedural language that has no keywords and that is actually usable.

In nest the keywords should represent what they do, for example `?..` is `while`
and `..?` is `do-while`, each representing when the condition is checked.
Another fitting example is the `import` operator `|#|` that resembles a written
file.

## Getting started

To get started with Nest first check out the [installation](installation.md)
documentation for installing it.

After that is done you should be able through the command-line (or command
prompt) to use Nest:

```text
$ nest
USAGE: nest [options] <filename | -c command> [args]
Run 'nest --help' for more information
```

From here you can read the [general syntax](syntax.md) of Nest programs or start
creating [your own C library](tutorials/c-lib-tutorial.md).
